# This example demonstrates how to use the buildargs field in the build step.
# The buildargs field allows you to pass build-time variables to the Dockerfile.

  buildargs-step:
    build:
      buildargs:
        MY_VERSION: 2.0
      dockerfile: |

        ARG MY_VERSION
        LABEL version=$MY_VERSION

    # To view the label in the built image do the following:
    #  1. Uncomment the following 'push:' line
    #  2. Run 'PYTHONPATH=. ./bin/buildrunner -f examples/build/buildargs/buildrunner.yaml'
