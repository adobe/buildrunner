# Example of a buildrunner.yaml file that specifies a multi-platform build step.
# The 'platforms' field is optional and can be used to specify the platforms for the build step.
# If the 'platforms' field is not specified, by default it will build a single platform, using the native platform of the machine running buildrunner.
