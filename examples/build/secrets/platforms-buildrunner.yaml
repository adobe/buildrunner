# In order to use secrets, you need to set use-legacy-builder to false in the config file OR
# add platforms to the build section
# To run this example, you need to set the SECRET_PASSWORD environment variable
# and run the example with the following command:
# SECRET2=my_secret ./run-buildrunner.sh -f examples/build/secrets/platforms-buildrunner.yaml
# More info about secrets: https://docs.docker.com/build/building/secrets/
