# This example demonstrates how to import a tarball image in the build step.
# This requires the tarball image to be present in the same directory where buildrunnner is executed.
# Before running this example, make sure to create a tarball image using the following command:
# docker save alpine:latest -o alpine.tar
#
# WARNING: Do not commit the tarball image to the repository.
#
