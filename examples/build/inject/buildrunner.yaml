# This example demonstrates how to use the inject field to inject a file into the build context.
# Note: This example does NOT specify a 'path' attribute. When path is not explicitly specified,
# the source directory is NOT copied into the build context, which improves build performance by
# avoiding unnecessary file copying. Only the explicitly injected files are included in the build context.
# See buildrunner documentation for more information.
